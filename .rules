# Sup

## Overview

sup is a WhatsApp CLI and bot framework.
It's extensible via plugins in /plugins and handlers in internal/bot/handlers/.

README.md gives an overview of the project.
The docs/ directory contains additional documentation, including plugin and handler development documentation.

## Rules

When writing code:

* Don't add new examples unless I explicitly tell you so
* Don't add documentation unless I explicity tell you so
* Don't add new test unless I explicitly tell you so
* The whatapp library to communicate with WhatApp services is https://github.com/tulir/whatsmeow
* Plugins are built and installed using script/install-plugins
* Important documenation lives in README.md and docs/
* Handlers are written in Go and live in internal/bot/Handlers
* Plugins are essentially Handlers loaded externally, not built-in. Their interface lives in pkg/plugin
* Plugins are WASM modules
* Plugins can be written in any language supported by Extistm (https://extism.org/docs/quickstart/plugin-quickstart) and live in /plugins
